## Status Submission Tutorial

This is a means of creating a How-To Guide for the Status.im Global Hackathon.

All projects have been opened as issues in the [Status Hackathon Repo](https://github.com/status-im/hackathon/issues) and will be closed by Pull Requests with the code necessary to run their DApp.

This format is unique as it ensures that all code - like Status.im itself - remains free (libre) and completely open source.

Thank you so much to everyone who has so patiently and intelligently taken part in this first (of hopefully many) Status hackathons!
